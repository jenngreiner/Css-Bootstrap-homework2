## User Story
As a new web developer, I need a web application that allows prospective employers and clients to view my work and contact me on a variety of device-types.

## Description 
This project is my current working portfolio. Created using BootStrap CSS Framework to achieve a responsive, mobile-first design that allows users to view the web application on any device, mobile or desktop, and Images and content visually change based on the device type used.
