## User Story
As a new web developer, I need a web application that allows prospective employers and clients to view my work and contact me on a variety of device-types.

## Description 
This project is my current working portfolio. To achieve a responsive, mobile-first design that allows users to view the web application on any device, mobile or desktop, I used BootStrap CSS grid formatting. This allows the navibar, images, and page contents to visually change depending on the width of the browser window.
